# rpi-temp-sensor
This is me just trying to collect some temperature (and possibly other data) of my house.

## setup
Make sure to install the submodule `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`.
And then also remember to run the python setup script `sudo python setup.py install` from within the Adafruit repo.
